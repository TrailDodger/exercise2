## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
# In this document I will copy and paste my notes from class on 1-23
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
f<- file.choose()
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
class(d)
str(d)
glimpse(d)
head(d)
# the str and glimpse function give you similar information on your data
# Using head can be more specific that the first 10 (or, in the case of tail, the last 10) by adding a comma 
# Running the view function will open the table view so that you can locally view your data
gs <- d$MeanGroupSize
class(gs)
head(gs)
head(gs +1)
# This adds 1 to the value of every number in that column of the data
# To view the group size field as a column rather than a row, use d[,"MeanGroupSize] when setting the variable
mean(gs)
# This returns a null value because that vector is missing data
sd(gs)
# Same error is returned for the standard deviation function for the same reason 
# This can be amended by telling the program to ignore null values
mean(gs, na.rm = TRUE)
# Paste takes a list of vectors as arguments and manipulates the data to have them pasted together
sciname <- paste(d$Genus, d$Species, sep =" ")
head(sciname) 
# The paste 0 function works similarly but does not specify a separator
# The unique function will search through a vector of data a will pull out the unique ones- or values that deviate from the norm, which can be useful for removing replicates
name <- unique(d$Genus)
# writing this with the double bracket operator will work when applied to a dataframe
head(d)
# There's also a process in which you can use the source function to call code that you've written in another script
# Potentially useful for the jag data stats? i.e. if I can create a more general code for HR calcs


#To include a code block that doesn't have the messy bits, use #/ include:false
```
# I don't really know why I popped those into code blocks
# Force of habit
```{r}
getwd()
```
